# Star Wars Battlegrounds - HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery

My second venture into responsive web-browser games was Star Wars Battlegrounds. The player is allowed to pick Sith or Jedi, and fight to the death against the other side with dynamic Health, Attack, and Enemies. 

This project allowed me to explore new methods of creating variables, manipulating them on events, and displaying results to the browser window. I also used jQuery to select targets, change styling on events, and let the user choose their own destiny.

Choose your favorite Star Wars character and go play!
